    // immutable borrowing 
    // creating a new string stored in heap s holds a pointer on the stack to "hello" in the heap s owns the data

    // &s = we are not moving but we are borrowint it using &s you can read only access but the original variable s still owns it 

    // mutable borrowing only one mutable borrowing is allowed in rust

    let s = String::from("hello");
    print_reference(&s);

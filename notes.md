u need to compile everytime after every change 
primitive datatypes or scalar datatypes
rust is statically typed language 
int float bool char

Integer rust has signed ( + and -) and unsigned integer only has +types of diff sizes

i8,i16,i32,i64,i128 : signed integers could be positive or negative
u8, u16, u32, u64,u128 : unsigned integers are only positive

diff between i8,i16...i128 smaller the number smaller the range they can have

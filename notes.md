u need to compile everytime after every change 
primitive datatypes or scalar datatypes
rust is statically typed language 
int float bool char

Integer rust has signed ( + and -) and unsigned integer only has +types of diff sizes

i8,i16,i32,i64,i128 : signed integers could be positive or negative
u8, u16, u32, u64,u128 : unsigned integers are only positive

diff between i8,i16...i128 smaller the number smaller the range they can have

even if we use let keyword variables are by default immutable in rust to make it mutable use mut keyword

shadowing - we can redefine the same variable with same name in same scope in rust so its intersting

if i define a variable as a mut one then we can change the value but not the type that means x here should be indeed an integer only so yeah trickyy

constants  We need to definetly define the typeof variable while using const also declaring and initialised at the same time in rust also shadowing doesnt work in const
also mutable doesnt work
